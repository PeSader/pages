# Pages

Pages is a simple website meant to be used as your browser startpage. It features a tabbed design, allowing quick access to a lot of links without compromising tidiness.

Personally, these tabs have been especially useful to sort my bookmarks by the day of the week. I've been having plenty of online classes, so it's been nice to have all links to meetings in a single neatly organized place.

### The code
About 90% of this project's code was written by reddit user [u/areking](https://www.reddit.com/user/areking/). I mostly just changed the colorscheme and introduced some bugs. Feel free to checkout his original code right [here](https://pastebin.com/8Yu5v9iv), as well as his post on r/startpages right [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/startpages/comments/n0e6ex/minimal_design_for_plenty_of_bookmarks/).

### The colors
The color pallete is [Nord](https://www.nordtheme.com/), which was created and is maintained by [Arctic Ice Studio](https://github.com/arcticicestudio).
